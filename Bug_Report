Bug - Load Document - Editing Buttons

Title:     Lack of clarity in "Edit" buttons
Severity:  3
Tester:    Mária Aksamít
Version:   uuDocKit 5.30.0
Test case: Manage Sheet Content

Steps:
Edit the sheet.
Edit within the section.
Confirm the edits.
Error: There is an excessive number of buttons required for editing, causing confusion during the editing process.
The pencil icon button is only visible when hovering over the image, which is problematic, especially when editing on a mobile phone where tapping the image should allow editing of the entire section (image gallery), which is not intuitive.

Fix:      Optimize the number of "Edit" buttons and always display the pencil icon button.
